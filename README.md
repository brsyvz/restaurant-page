<h3 id=about>About</h3>
I have developed this project to practice on webpack.

<h3 id="gl">Game logic</h3>

+ I add event listeners to the navigation links. Each navigation link wipes out the current content and then runs the correct "modules" to populate it again.
+ Each module will export a function that creates a div element, adds the appropriate content and styles to that element and then appends it to the DOM

<h3 id="la">Learning outcomes</h3>

- I have learned the basics of webpack and applied it to bundle my modules.
- Create and update the page contents by javascript.
- Import and export javascript functions between modules.
